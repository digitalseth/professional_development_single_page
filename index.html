  <h1>My Professional Development</h1>
  
  <h2>2005</h2>
  <p>My first job started when I was 15 years old. I mowed our neighbors lawn along with my brother. I was overly attentive to detail and scared of any failures.</p>
  
  <h2>2006</h2>
  <p>I got my first "real" job after applying and interviweing with Williiams Hardware. I was very shy and socially inept. My confidence grew and grew as I interacted with more people very day. My boss was very encouraging and took me under his wing. I became very comfortable with social interaction, even craving it.</p>
  
  <h2>2014</h2>
  <p>After arriving on campus to start the second half of my collegiate career, I obtained a small job within the first week of arrival. This job was with the office of campus life. I performed duties in a few different locations on campus including the recreation center, welcome desk, and suite. </p>
  
  <h2>2015</h2>
  <p>I wanted to get an on-campus job that was more relevant to my major in Information Technology so I applied to a computer lab support position. I was hired almost instantly and started to learn some real-world networking on the job. I was able to get two projects off the ground that had previously been unifinshed.</p>
  
  <h2>2016</h2>
  <p>I applied to many interships and started to get more comfortable with the interview process. After a one hour interview with TransUnion, I was accepted into a 12 week summer intership program.</p>
