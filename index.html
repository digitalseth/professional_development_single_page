  <h2>2005</h2>
  <p>My first job started when I was 15 years old. I mowed our neighbors lawn along 
  with my brother. I was overly attentive to detail and scared of any failures.</p>

  <h2>2006</h2>
  <p>I got my first "real" job after applying and interviewing with Williams Hardware. 
  I was very shy and socially inept. My confidence grew and grew as I interacted with 
  more people very day. My boss was very encouraging and took me under his wing. 
  I became very comfortable with social interaction, even to the point of loving it.</p>

  <h2>2014</h2>
  <p>After arriving in Chicago to start the second half of my collegiate career, 
  I obtained a job within the first week. This job was with the office of campus 
  life. I performed duties in a few different locations on campus 
  including the recreation center, welcome desk, and suite. </p>

  <h2>2015</h2>
  <p>I wanted to get an on-campus job that was more relevant to my major in Information 
  Technology so I applied to a computer lab support position. I was hired almost 
  instantly and started to learn some real-world networking on the job. I was able 
  to get two projects off the ground that had previously been unifinished.</p>

  <h2>2016</h2>
  <p>I applied to many internships and started to get more comfortable with the interview 
  process. After a one hour interview with TransUnion, I was accepted into a 12 week 
  summer internship program. And that's where I am in life.</p>
